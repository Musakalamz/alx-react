# 🚀 0X08 Alx-React Redux Reducer & Selector Project 🎨

Welcome to the Alx-React Redux Reducer & Selector Project! This project aims to teach you about reducers, selectors, and their usage within a React application.

This module begins the process of creating Reducers and Selectors for Redux

Reducers take in the state or part of the state of the application, and apply an action to the store. An action describes something that happened in the application, such as clicking a button or marking a notification as read. The Reducers change the store based on what happened in the action, and return a new state. So when a user logs in, the state should update to reflect a user's information. The redux store takes all the reducers and keeps them on hand for when various actions are logged to the store.

Selectors take what's currently in the state and returns them very simply to any part of the program that is asking for them. They're just accessor methods that look at very specific values in the state and make them accessible to the rest of the program.

## ⚙️ Requirements

- Editors: vi, vim, emacs, Visual Studio Code
- Files should end with a new line
- Interpretation/compilation on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using node 12.x.x and npm 6.x.x
- **Mandatory README.md file at the project root**

## 📝 Tasks

### Task 0: Write a Basic Reducer

Create a basic reducer for UI state handling. This includes functionalities like displaying/hiding notifications, and managing user login/logout.

### Task 1: Use Immutable for the UI Reducer

Implement Immutable.js to enhance the efficiency of the UI reducer.

### Task 2: Create a Reducer for Courses

Develop a reducer for managing courses. This involves loading courses from an API, selecting/unselecting courses, and updating the state accordingly.

### Task 3: Create a Reducer for Notifications

Design a reducer for handling notifications. This includes loading notifications from an API, marking notifications as read, and filtering notifications.

### Task 4: Normalizr & Immutable

Utilize Normalizr and Immutable.js to simplify state mutation and improve performance.

### Task 5: Selectors

Implement selectors for efficiently accessing data from the notification reducer.
